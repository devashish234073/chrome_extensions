## AI Project Creator

Launch the backend by running 

```
node server.js
```

This will start the backend application that is a wrapper over the locally running ollama api (make sure you have downloaded and installed ollama in your local)

Next for chrome extension you need to load the extension from the ai_project_Creator folder 
You can refer to this video for that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz_MAw8P5e0

The entire development is being done in a sequence of videos, below is the list in sequence

The extension shows up a popup with text captured from the current page:

After ollama api call completes the parsed response is returned:
