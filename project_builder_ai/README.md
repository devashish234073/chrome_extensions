## AI Project Creator

Launch the backend by running 

```
node server.js
```

This will start the backend application that is a wrapper over the locally running ollama api (make sure you have downloaded and installed ollama in your local)

Next for chrome extension you need to load the extension from the ai_project_Creator folder
